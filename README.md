# PostgreSQL Container Images

Maintenance scripts to generate Immutable Application Containers
for all available PostgreSQL versions (12 to 17) to be used as
operands with the [CloudNativePG operator](https://cloudnative-pg.io)
for Kubernetes.

These images are built on top of the [Official Postgres image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
maintained by the [PostgreSQL Docker Community](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres),
by adding the following software:

- Barman Cloud
- PGAudit
- Postgres Failover Slots
- pgvector
